### **Gameplay and Rules:**

As the curtains rise, a random string of binary numbers forms the foundation for your journey—a fresh tableau for every match. Strategy unfurls as players alternate moves, with each turn defined by a skillful substitution of adjacent numbers. A duo of digits transforms under your calculated choices: 00 to 1, 01 to 0, 10 to 1, and 11 to 0—a dance of logic and tactics.

Every exchange brings you closer to a gripping crescendo—a pair of numbers standing firm. The climax is revealed as symmetry or dissimilarity paints the canvas. If unity reigns, the torch passes to the player who initiated this journey. Yet, if duality persists, victory crowns the challenger who responded with precision.

### **Key Features:**

- **MiniMax Strategy:** Engage in a cerebral tango, masterminded by the MiniMax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning. Immerse yourself in dynamic gameplay, where calculated moves hold the key to triumph.

- **Choice of Starting Player:** Seize control with the power to decide who takes the inaugural step. Strategy and advantage become intertwined, redefining each match's tempo.

- **Persisting Progress:** Navigate the ebb and flow of the game, even if reality beckons a reload. Data remains steadfast, saving your in-game choices and positions—ensuring continuity in every session.

- **Row Length Customization:** Craft your battlefield with precision. Tailor the length of the binary row, defining optimal and maximal lengths (up to 10). A strategic canvas awaits your touch.
